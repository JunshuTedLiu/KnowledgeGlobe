In the last two decades, a community has been formed that addresses issues in argumentation theory focusing on methods and problems as studied in artificial intelligence. Much of this work is formal or computational in nature, but often has a relevance that goes beyond artificial intelligence per se. This chapter is an attempt to show this relevance to a wider audience by focusing on key ideas and themes and less on formal and computational detail. The chapter starts with historic roots of the treatment of argumentation in artificial intelligence, by discussing non-monotonic logic, in particular Raymond Reiter\u2019s logic of default reasoning and logic programming, and defeasible reasoning, where especially John Pollock\u2019s multifaceted treatment of argument defeat has shaped how argumentation is handled in artificial intelligence. The chapter continues with what is known in the field as abstract argumentation. In abstract argumentation, the focus of study is on attack between arguments, as an abstract formal relation, an approach proposed and developed by Phan Minh Dung. This approach has become very influential, but by its formal mathematical nature can prove daunting. Many key ideas can be explained in elementary terms, which is what we have aimed to do in Sect. 11.4. Then follows a discussion of artificial intelligence research into argument structure, with treatments of the role of argument specificity, conclusive force, the relation with classical logic, and the combination of support and attack. Next we treat argument schemes and argumentation dialogues, two areas of study where there is an especially strong cross-fertilization between argumentation theory and artificial intelligence. In part this can be explained by the study of argumentation by AI researchers focusing on the field of law and by the rise of the multi-agent systems perspective in computer science and artificial intelligence. Specific themes reviewed in the chapter are reasoning with rules and with cases, the role of the audience and values, argumentation support software, burden of proof and evidence, and argument strength. All in all we hope that the chapter helps to enhance the collaboration between artificial intelligence and argumentation theory.", "number": "", "publicationName": "Handbook of Argumentation Theory", "publicationDate": "2021-01-01", "electronicIsbn": "978-94-007-6883-3", "openaccess": "false", "copyright": "\u00a92021 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht", "title": "Argumentation and Artificial Intelligence", "conferenceInfo": [], "identifier": "doi:10.1007/978-94-007-6883-3_11-1", "contentType": "Chapter", "printIsbn": "", "volume": "", "startingPage": "", "genre": "ReviewPaper", "publisher": "Springer", "doi": "10.1007/978-94-007-6883-3_11-1", "onlineDate": "", "url": [{"platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-6883-3_11-1", "format": ""}], "printDate": "", "creators": [{"creator": "Eemeren, Frans H."}, {"creator": "Garssen, Bart"}, {"creator": "Krabbe, Erik C.

However, during the implementation into the home, issues of physical space and technology integration may occur. There are many types of dwellings (apartments, houses, or bungalows) where older adults reside which contain a variety of fixtures and furnishings.

Modeling studies of mono- and disaccharides, primarily by the author and colleagues, have been reviewed and additional analyses were furnished that relate the conformations found in crystal structures to the adiabatic energies through a Boltzmann-like distribution. Those decreases in the numbers of observed crystal structures with increasing energy, discussed earlier by Dunitz and coworkers, suggest that the consequences of crystal packing forces are equivalent to the distribution of structures that would be found at about 500 K for non-crystalline molecules. A closing study of a large oligosaccharide, a cycloamylose with 26 glucose residues (CA26), revealed the extent to which energy minimization studies could retain molecular features found in crystal structures of a large carbohydrate. As also done for the disaccharides, both empirical force fields (molecular mechanics) and density functional theory (quantum mechanics) were employed. Some intrinsic features of the CA26 were reproduced, but the detailed results from the different modeling methods diverged.

First, attention is paid to research in some disciplines and research programs that connect with argumentation theory and may even have some overlap with it. In Sect. 12.2 critical discourse analysis is discussed, in Sect. 12.3 historical controversy analysis, in Sect. 12.4 persuasion research and related quantitative research projects, and in Sect. 12.5 studies stemming from relevance theory which promote an argumentative turn in cognitive psychology.The next chapters concentrate on developments in argumentation research that have taken place in non-Anglophone parts of the world, in which research results are often published in other languages than English. Concentrating on contributions which have not yet been discussed in other chapters, in Sect. 12.6 an overview of argumentation research in the Nordic countries is given, in Sect. 12.7 of argumentation studies in German-speaking areas, and in Sect. 12.8 of argumentation studies in Dutch-speaking areas. The study of argumentation in French-speaking areas is discussed in Sect. 12.9, and the study of argumentation in Italian-speaking areas in Sect. 12.10.The next areas focused on are Eastern Europe, in Sect. 12.11, and Russia and other parts of the former USSR, in Sect. 12.12. Section 12.13 is devoted to the state of the art in argumentation theory in Spanish-speaking areas and Sect. 12.14 to the state of the art in Portuguese-speaking areas. Next, in Sect. 12.15 argumentation research in Israel is discussed, and in Sect. 12.16 argumentation research in the Arab world.

The role of atom is taken over by a continuum particle or quasi-particle, a basic constitutive unit that can represent, for example, a grain of ceramics, a concrete aggregate, and a particle of a composite. The computation domain is discretized into regular or random network of such particles generally interacting through nonlinear potentials within the realm of Newtonian dynamics.

The term forensics has been attached to many different fields: economics, anthropology, dentistry, pathology, toxicology, entomology, psychology, accounting, engineering, and computer forensics. Forensic evidence is gathered, examined, evaluated, interpreted, and presented to make sense of an event and provide investigatory leads. Various classification schemes exist for forensic evidence, with some forms of evidence falling under more than one scheme. Rules of evidence differ between jurisdictions, even between countries that share similar legal traditions. This makes the sharing of evidence between countries particularly problematic, at times rendering this evidence inadmissible in national courts.
