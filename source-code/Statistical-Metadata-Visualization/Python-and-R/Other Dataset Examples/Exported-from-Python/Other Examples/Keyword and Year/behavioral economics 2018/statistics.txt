Research suggests that individual time preference may be associated with unhealthy behaviors. However, empirical evidence of this for physical activity is scant. This study investigated the relationship between time preference and physical activity, and how this might influence behavior change.MethodsEmployees (n\u2009=\u2009176; mean age 42.2\u2009years) who participated in a physical activity intervention were invited to take part in a behavioral economic field experiment. Two economic experiments, using multiple price lists and monetary trade-off tables involving real money choices, were conducted face-to-face with participants to measure the two components of time preference, namely present-bias and discount rate. Together with individual risk preferences, these three variables were jointly estimated by maximum likelihood. These three parameters were expressed as a linear function of the levels of physical activity while controlling for socio-demographic variables within the same maximum likelihood framework.ResultsThose who were present-biased and who had higher discount rates did significantly less physical activity than their patient and non present-biased counterparts. A 3% lower discount rate and 1.14 unit decrement in the present-bias parameter was associated with a 30\u2009min increase of physical activity per week. This negative association was more significant for certain sub-groups, such as younger and married adults and those with higher staff grade and those who have children. Participants who dropped out of the study earlier were more present-biased.ConclusionsResults demonstrated that discount rate and present-biasedness have a significant impact on physical activity levels. Such concepts have been largely overlooked and underutilized in physical activity interventions.

The association was stronger among older people (25+\u00a0years). This suggests that HIV risk perception can be accurate but the higher HIV incidence (1.27 per 100 person-years) illustrates that individuals may face barriers to HIV prevention behaviour even when they perceive their risks. Gaps in risk perception are underlined by the high incidence among those not perceiving a risk (0.96%), low risk perception even among those reporting potentially risky sexual behaviour, and, particularly, lack of accuracy of risk perception among young people.

Keynes and F.H. Knight, the two great pioneers of the economics of uncertainty. Ellsberg seems to be a man in paradox. Although his remarkable paper on ambiguity and decision was published in a prestigious journal in 1962, it had not received due attention for a long time. Because he was so preoccupied in the 1960s and onward by letting the general public know the Pentagon papers, he could virtually have no time left to engage in purely academic activities. In the 21st century, however, the times have changed in favor of Ellsberg: we can see the dramatic return of interest in decision making under ambiguity. In this paper, we first deal with uncertainties that are not risks. A focal point of discussion will be the similarity and difference between Keynes and Knight. Kenneth Arrow\u2019s skepticism about Knight on uncertainty will also be paid due attention. We will then turn to the main part of this paper, that is, the concept of ambiguity that was first introduced by Ellsberg. Both the two-color and the three-color problems will systematically be examined by help of numerical representations. While there are a variety of ways including the Nishimura\u2013Ozaki approach for the resolution of the so-called Ellsberg paradox, the Keynesian approach by means of interval-valued probabilities, which was recently revived by Brady and applied by Sakai in many ways, is very simple and highly effective. In our opinion, the most amazing Ellsberg paradox lies in the fact that an accomplished economist specialized in the aversion of risk and uncertainty has dared to make a personal choice to risk everything such as degrading his social status and putting him in prison for a long period. Surely, the intellectual legacy of Ellsberg seems to be an intriguing research in paradox.", "coverDate": "", "number": "", "publicationName": "Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review", "publicationDate": "2018-12-17", "endingPage": "18", "openaccess": "false", "printDate": "", "copyright": "\u00a92018 Japan Association for Evolutionary Economics", "title": "Daniel Ellsberg on J.M.

However, implementation of marker-assisted selection techniques remains a challenge in many breeding programs worldwide. Many factors contribute to this lack of adoption, such as uncertainty in how to integrate MAS with traditional breeding processes, lack of confidence in MAS as a tool, and the expense of the process. However, developments in genomics tools, locus validation techniques, and new models for how to utilise QTLs in breeding programs stand to address these issues. Marker-assisted forward breeding needs to be enabled through the identification of robust QTLs, the design of reliable marker systems to select for these QTLs, and the delivery of these QTLs into elite genomic backgrounds to enable their use without associated genetic drag. To enhance the adoption and effectiveness of MAS, rice is used as an example of how to integrate new developments and processes into a coherent, efficient strategy for utilising genetic variation.

We employed a well-grounded discounting paradigm with a fixed-sequence procedure and the Subjective Probability Questionnaire across different magnitudes of gains and losses. We replicated prior findings indicating that the magnitude effect (observed in delay discounting) or the reverse magnitude effect (observed in probability discounting) are present for monetary gains but not for monetary losses. We found that the subjective probability of receiving future outcomes is amount-dependent for gains but not for losses. We propose that the magnitude effect can be a by-product of the risk associated with future payoffs of different magnitudes, as shown by mediation analysis.

Therefore, individual control over personal data has become an important subject in European privacy law. Compared to its predecessor, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) addresses the need for more individual control over personal data more explicitly. With the introduction of several new principles that seem to empower individuals in gaining more control over their data, its changes relative to its predecessors are substantial. It appears, however, that, to increase individual control, data protection law relies on certain assumptions about human decision making. In this work, we challenge these assumptions and describe the actual mechanisms of human decision making in a personal data context. Further, we analyse the extent to which new provisions in the GDPR effectively enhance individual control through a behavioural lens. To guide our analysis, we identify three stages of data processing in the data economy: (1) the information receiving stage, (2) the approval and primary use stage, and (3) the secondary use (reuse) stage. For each stage, we identify the pitfalls of human decision-making that typically emerge and form a threat to individual control. Further, we discuss how the GDPR addresses these threats by means of several legal provisions. Finally, keeping in mind the pitfalls in human decision-making, we assess how effective the new legal provisions are in enhancing individual control. We end by concluding that these legal instruments seem to have made a step towards more individual control, but some threats to individual control remain entrenched in the GDPR.", "coverDate": "", "number": "", "publicationName": "Journal of Consumer Policy", "publicationDate": "2018-12-11", "endingPage": "17", "openaccess": "true", "printDate": "", "copyright": "\u00a92018 The Author(s)", "title": "Does the GDPR Enhance Consumers\u2019 Control over Personal Data?

Ultimatum game (UG) is a standard behavioral task that focuses on interpersonal behavior when splitting a sum of money between two players. UG studies consistently demonstrate that people tend to decrease their inequity in outcomes, one explanation being that economically irrational decision-making may partly arise from the emotions guilt and envy. We assumed that AN patients would perform excessively fair in UG, reflecting high guilt and envy.MethodsWe utilized UG to investigate the characteristics of guilt and envy among 24 Japanese AN patients and 22 age-matched healthy controls (HC). The relation between the outcome of UG and decision strategy confirmed by post-experimental questionnaires was analyzed.ResultsAs proposer, AN offered a larger amount to the responder compared with HC (p\u2009=\u20090.002) while, on the other hand, as responder, AN demanded much higher allocation to accept the offer compared with HC (p\u2009=\u20090.026).

Using paradigms from behavioural economics, we tested the prediction that legal cannabis would be an asymmetrical substitute for illegal cannabis, with legal cannabis operating as a superior commodity based on its regulated status. In a sample of 289 adult cannabis users in Ontario, we found evidence of substitutability for both legal and illegal cannabis, but significantly lower substitutability of illegal for legal cannabis, a pattern that was also present for price elasticity (\u03b1) and Pmax. Thus, the data indicated asymmetric substitution such that the availability of legal cannabis substantially decreased demand for illegal cannabis, but a significantly smaller effect in reverse. These results suggest that the introduction of legal cannabis into the market may disrupt and reduce illegal purchases, contributing to the reduction of the potential harms associated with the illegal market. However, in revealing price windows in which legal cannabis is preferred over the contraband alternative, these data also have significant implications for pricing policies.R\u00e9sum\u00e9Dans le contexte de la l\u00e9galisation du cannabis, l\u2019une des grandes questions qui se posent chez les cliniciens, les responsables des politiques et dans la population est de savoir si la disponibilit\u00e9 du cannabis l\u00e9gal r\u00e9duira sensiblement la consommation (la demande) du cannabis ill\u00e9gal. \u00c0 l\u2019aide des paradigmes de l\u2019\u00e9conomie comportementale, nous avons test\u00e9 la pr\u00e9diction selon laquelle le cannabis l\u00e9gal sera un substitut asym\u00e9trique au cannabis ill\u00e9gal et constituera un produit sup\u00e9rieur en raison de son statut r\u00e9glement\u00e9.

A number of controversial policies, including implementation of a presumed consent organ donation system, have been considered to rectify the organ donation crisis.AimsA secondary retrospective data analysis aimed to assess the impact of switching to a presumed consent organ donation model on organ donation rates.MethodsDeceased organ donation rates were compared before and after countries adopted presumed consent.ResultsSix countries met entry criteria. All six countries had an increase in liver donation rates, while 4 out of the six countries had an increase in kidney donation rates. The overall mean (\u00b1\u2009SD) liver donation rate was 3.23 (\u00b1\u20090.97) per million population (pmp) before the transition and 6.46 (\u00b1\u20091.81) pmp after the transition (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The overall mean (\u00b1\u2009SD) kidney donation rate was 17.94 (\u00b1\u20093.34) pmp before the transition and 26.58 (\u00b1\u20094.23) pmp after the transition (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The percentage increase in liver and kidney donation rates varied among countries, ranging from 28 to 1186%.ConclusionThe transition from explicit to presumed consent was associated with a significant increase in liver donation rates in all countries that met our criteria, while the effect on kidney donation rates was partially realized. Although presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain the increase in donation rates, the adoption of such a policy may prove to be a worthwhile risk for countries experiencing consistently low organ donation rates.", "coverDate": "", "number": "", "publicationName": "Digestive Diseases and Sciences", "publicationDate": "2018-12-05", "endingPage": "10", "openaccess": "false", "printDate": "", "copyright": "\u00a92018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature", "title": "Presumed Consent: A Potential Tool for Countries Experiencing an Organ Donation Crisis", "identifier": "doi:10.1007/s10620-018-5388-6", "contentType": "Article", "topicalCollection": "", "volume": "", "startingPage": "1", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "eissn": "", "publisher": "Springer", "doi": "10.1007/s10620-018-5388-6", "onlineDate": "", "url": [{"platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10620-018-5388-6", "format": ""}], "articleCategory": "", "issn": "1573-2568", "issuetype": "", "creators": [{"creator": "Saab, Sammy"}, {"creator": "Saggi, Satvir S."}, {"creator": "Akbar, Mizna"}, {"creator": "Choi, Gina"}]}, {"journalid": "11369", "abstract": "AbstractWhat is the strategic value of flexible labor contracts to workers?

The relationship between the social determinants of health (SDoH) and behavioural science in health policy has not hitherto been explored. Given the on-going presence of strategies based on findings from behavioural science in policy-making on the political agenda, an examination of this is warranted. This paper begins by looking at the place of the SDoH within public health, before outlining, in brief, the recent drive towards utilising behavioural science to formulate law and public policy. We then examine the relationship between this and the SDoH. We argue that behavioural public health policy is, to a certain extent, blind to the social and other determinants of health. In section three, we examine ways in which such policies may perpetuate and/or exacerbate health inequities and social injustices. We argue that problems in this respect may be compounded by assumptions and practices which are built into some behavioural science methodologies. We also argue that incremental individual gains may not be enough. As such, population-level measures are sometimes necessary.

Focussing on a region of the parameter space that exhibits multi-stability, we apply the stochastic sensitivity function technique and Lyapunov exponents to scrutinize the dynamics of the stochastic economic system. We find that the savings rate affects the sensitivity of the economic system, as well as the distribution of economic states. The sensitivity of the system is inversely related to the level of the savings rate. Specifically, we demonstrate that high volatility phases of the cycle vary as the savings rate is changed. For low (high) levels of the savings rate the stochastic Goodwin economy will remain relatively often in sensitive (robust) states.

The main direction of progressive evolution of social insects, in particular, ants, is the development of the social way of life inextricably linked with the increase in the colony size. Only in a large colony, it is possible to have a developed polyethism, create large food reserves, and actively regulate the nest micro\u2013climate. The lifespan of ants hugely varies among genetically similar queens, workers (unproductive females), and males. The main advantage of studies on insects is the determinism of ontogenetic processes, with a single genome leading to completely different lifespans in different castes. This high degree of determinacy is precisely the reason why some researchers (incorrectly) call a colony of ants the \u201csuperorganism\u201d, emphasizing the fact that during the development, depending on the community needs, ants can switch their ontogenetic programs, which influences their social roles, ability to learn (i.e., the brain [mushroom\u2013like body] plasticity), and, respectively, the spectrum of tasks performed by a given individual. It has been shown that in many types of food behavior, older ants surpass young ones in both performing the tasks and transferring the experience. The balance between the need to reduce the \u201ccost\u201d of non\u2013breeding individuals (short lifespan and small size of workers) and the benefit from experienced long\u2013lived workers possessing useful skills (large size and \u201cnon\u2013aging\u201d) apparently determines the differences in the lifespan and aging rate of workers in different species of ants. A large spectrum of rigidly determined ontogenetic trajectories in different castes with identical genomes and the possibility of comparison between \u201cevolutionarily advanced\u201d and \u201cprimitive\u201d subfamilies (e.g., Formicinae and Ponerinae) make ants an attractive object in the studies of both normal aging and effects of anti\u2013aging drugs.", "coverDate": "", "number": "12-13", "publicationName": "Biochemistry (Moscow)", "publicationDate": "2018-12-01", "endingPage": "1503", "openaccess": "false", "printDate": "", "copyright": "\u00a92018 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.", "title": "Ants as Object of Gerontological Research", "identifier": "doi:10.1134/S0006297918120076", "contentType": "Article", "topicalCollection": "", "volume": "83", "startingPage": "1489", "genre": "ReviewPaper", "eissn": "", "publisher": "Springer", "doi": "10.1134/S0006297918120076", "onlineDate": "", "url": [{"platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0006297918120076", "format": ""}], "articleCategory": "", "issn": "1608-3040", "issuetype": "", "creators": [{"creator": "Shilovsky, G.

In such interactions, the ISA mediates the user\u2019s access to the content, or controls some other aspect of the user experience, and is not designed to be neutral about outcomes of user choices. Like human users, ISAs are driven by goals, make autonomous decisions, and can learn from experience. Using ideas from bounded rationality (and deploying concepts from artificial intelligence, behavioural economics, control theory, and game theory), we frame these interactions as instances of an ISA whose reward depends on actions performed by the user. Such agents benefit by steering the user\u2019s behaviour towards outcomes that maximise the ISA\u2019s utility, which may or may not be aligned with that of the user. Video games, news recommendation aggregation engines, and fitness trackers can all be instances of this general case. Our analysis facilitates distinguishing various subcases of interaction (i.e. deception, coercion, trading, and nudging), as well as second-order effects that might include the possibility for adaptive interfaces to induce behavioural addiction, and/or change in user belief. We present these types of interaction within a conceptual framework, and review current examples of persuasive technologies and the issues that arise from their use. We argue that the nature of the feedback commonly used by learning agents to update their models and subsequent decisions could steer the behaviour of human users away from what benefits them, and in a direction that can undermine autonomy and cause further disparity between actions and goals as exemplified by addictive and compulsive behaviour.
