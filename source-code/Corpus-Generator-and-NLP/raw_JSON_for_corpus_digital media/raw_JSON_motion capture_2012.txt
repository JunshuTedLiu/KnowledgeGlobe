Existing methods are diverse, providing inconsistent results. The current gold standard (bone pins) is prohibitively invasive. The purposes of the current study are to describe a virtual projection alternative to surface markers for video motion capture (VMC) of the scapula and to compare the results of the projection and surface marker methods to the results of similar existing methods.MethodsTen participants were evaluated using VMC. Surface markers were applied to the trunk and arm in accordance with existing guidelines. Three markers were affixed to plastic base on the skin over the acromion process. Other scapular landmarks were digitized in a neutral position. These landmarks\u2019 locations were defined in reference to the acromion cluster and used to generate the projection. Humerothoracic, glenohumeral, and scapulothoracic kinematics were evaluated during shoulder abduction, flexion, and scaption. Joint angles produced by the surface markers and the projection were compared by Bonferroni-adjusted t tests. The results were compared to prior findings in the literature.ResultsThe projection resulted in greater scapulothoracic upward rotation, internal rotation, and anterior\u2013posterior tilt and less glenohumeral elevation (p\u2009<\u2009.0055) than did surface markers. The virtual scapula produced greater estimates of scapular mobility than did surface markers, corresponding to pre-existing results from similar methodologies.ConclusionsThe result is a noninvasive measurement tool that produces different and superior results than do scapula surface markers.

The gait application consists of a set of wireless inertial sensors and an adaptive algorithm for the calculation of temporal gait parameters. Five healthy subjects were asked to walk and run on a treadmill at two different walking speeds (2 and 4\u00a0kph) and at a jogging (8\u00a0kph) and running (12\u00a0kph) speed. Data were simultaneously acquired from both systems. True error, percentage error and ICC scores indicate that the adaptive algorithm successfully calculated strides times across all speeds.

Patients presented with hip pain, clinical findings of FAI, and, frequently, with an identifiable lesion on MRI arthrography. The minimum clinical followup was 12\u00a0months (mean, 29\u00a0months; range, 12\u201372\u00a0months).ResultsThe consistent characteristics of these lesions associated with FAI differ from previously reported femoral chondral damage reported after hip dislocation or lateral impact in that there was no discrete injury such as a fall or dislocation/subluxation, no associated traumatic femoral lesion, and all were localized to the posterosuperior femoral head.

The current rationale for labral repair is based on restoring the suction-seal function and clinical reports suggesting improved clinical outcome scores when acetabular rim trimming is accompanied by labral repair. However, it is unclear whether available scientific evidence supports routine labral repair.Questions/PurposesThe questions raised in this review were: (1) does labral repair restore normal histologic structure, tissue permeability, hip hydrodynamics, load transfer, and in vivo kinematics; and (2) does labral repair favorably alter the natural course of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) treatment or age-related degeneration of the acetabular labrum?MethodsAn electronic literature search for the keywords acetabular labrum was performed. Three hundred fifty-five abstracts were reviewed and 52 selected for full-text review that described information concerning pertinent aspects of labral formation, development, degeneration, biomechanics, and clinical results of labral repair or resection.ResultsSeveral clinical studies support labral repair when performed in conjunction with acetabular rim trimming. Little data support or refute the use of routine labral repair for all patients with symptomatic labral damage associated with FAI. It is not known whether or how labral repair affects the natural course of FAI.ConclusionsBased on the current understanding of labral degenerative changes associated with mechanical hip abnormalities, the low biologic likelihood of restoring normal tissue characteristics, and mechanical data suggesting minimal consequence from small labral resections, routine labral repair over labral d\u00e9bridement is not supported.", "coverDate": "", "number": "12", "publicationName": "Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research\u00ae", "publicationDate": "2012-12-01", "endingPage": "3405", "openaccess": "false", "printDate": "", "copyright": "\u00a92012 The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons\u00ae", "title": "The Biomechanical Case for Labral D\u00e9bridement", "identifier": "doi:10.1007/s11999-012-2446-9", "contentType": "Article", "topicalCollection": "", "volume": "470", "startingPage": "3398", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "eissn": "", "publisher": "Springer", "doi": "10.1007/s11999-012-2446-9", "onlineDate": "", "url": [{"platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11999-012-2446-9", "format": ""}], "articleCategory": "", "issn": "1528-1132", "issuetype": "", "creators": [{"creator": "Zaltz, Ira"}]}, {"journalid": "12283", "abstract": "AbstractDynamic forces and range of motion (ROM) were measured during on-ice skating using a standard hockey skate and a modified skate (MS) with an altered tendon guard and eyelet configuration.

Thus, repair of focal cartilage defects in hips requires more invasive and technically complex surgeries than simple arthroscopy or arthrotomy. Autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) is a second-generation bone marrow stimulation technique. Improvement in Tegner, Lysholm, International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS), and Cincinnati scores has been reported at 1 and 2\u00a0years after AMIC in knees. AMIC is potentially useful to repair defects in hips, but it is unknown whether it relieves symptoms or results in a durable construct.Description of TechniqueA surgical hip dislocation is used to access the defect. This is d\u00e9brided to stable cartilage shoulders, necrotic bone is removed, and the lesion base is drilled. Autogenous bone graft is used for lesions with bony defects to create a level surface. Fibrin gel and a collagen membrane are placed to stabilize the superclot for fibrocartilage formation.MethodsWe treated six patients with AMIC in the hip between 2009 and 2010. We obtained Oxford Hip and UCLA Activity Scores. Repair quality was assessed on 6-month postoperative MRI using the modified magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) system. Minimum 1-year followup data were available for four patients (range, 1\u20132.5\u00a0years).ResultsPostoperative Oxford Hip Scores ranged from 13 to 17, UCLA Activity Scores ranged from 5 to 10, and MOCART scores ranged from 55 to 75. No complications occurred.ConclusionsWe describe AMIC in the hip.

The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of rear-wheel cambers on temporal-spatial parameters, joint angles, and propulsion patterns.MethodsTwelve inexperienced subjects (22.3\u00b11.6 yr) participated in the study. None had musculoskeletal disorders in their upper extremities. An eight-camera motion capture system was used to collect the three-dimensional trajectory data of markers attached to the wheelchair-user system during propulsion. All participants propelled the same wheelchair, which had an instrumented wheel with cambers of 0\u00b0, 9\u00b0, and 15\u00b0, respectively, at an average velocity of 1 m/s.ResultsThe results show that the rear-wheel camber significantly affects the average acceleration, maximum end angle, trunk movement, elbow joint movement, wrist joint movement, and propulsion pattern. The effects are especially significant between 0\u00b0 and 15\u00b0. For a 15\u00b0 camber, the average acceleration and joint peak angles significantly increased (p < 0.01).

This study compared overground walking to treadmill walking in a computer assisted virtual reality environment (CAREN) in individuals with and without transtibial amputations (TTA).MethodsSeven individuals with traumatic TTA and 27 unimpaired controls participated. Subjects walked overground and on a treadmill in a CAREN at a normalized speed. The CAREN applied optic flow at the same speed that the subject walked. Temporal-spatial parameters, full body kinematics, and kinematic variability were collected during all trials.ResultsBoth subject groups decreased step time and control subjects decreased step length when walking in the CAREN. Differences in lower extremity kinematics were small (< 2.5\u25cb) and did not exceed the minimal detectable change values for these measures. Control subjects exhibited decreased transverse and frontal plane range of motion of the pelvis and trunk when walking in the CAREN, while patients with TTA did not. Both groups exhibited increased step width variability during treadmill walking in the CAREN, but only minor changes in kinematic variability.ConclusionsThe results of this study suggest that treadmill training in a virtual environment should be similar enough to overground that changes should carry over.

Effect sizes for activity measures (d\u2019 = 0.7\u20131.6) were, on average, two-fold larger than differences in attention or impulsivity, correlated more strongly with executive function ratings and were more discriminatory (ROC area = 0.83 for activity composite, 0.65 for No-4\u2019s distraction composite, 0.63 for Conners\u2019 CPT-II confidence index, 0.96 for the combined activity and attention diagnostic index).

On the other hand, real-time remote tele-operation of robotic arms, either industrial or humanoid, is highly suitable for a number of applications, especially in difficult or inaccessible environment, and thus such an evaluation framework would be desirable. Usually, teleoperation is driven by buttons, joysticks, haptic controllers, or slave-arms, providing an interface which can be quite cumbersome and unnatural, especially when operating robots with multiple degrees of freedom. Thus, in thus paper, we present a two-fold contribution: (a) a task-based teleoperation evaluation framework which can achieve the desiderata described above, as well as (b) a system for teleoperation of an industrial arm commanded through human-arm motion capture, which is used as a case study, and also serves to illustrate the effectiveness of the evaluation framework that we are introducing. In our system the desired trajectory of a remote robotic arm is easily and naturally controlled through imitation of simple movements of the operator\u2019s physical arm, obtained through motion capture. Furthermore, an extensive real-world evaluation is provided, based on our proposed probabilistic framework, which contains an inter-subject quantitative study with 23 subjects, a longitudinal study with 6 subjects, as well as opinions and attitudes towards tele-operation study. The results provided illustrate the strengths of the proposed evaluation framework\u2014by enabling the quick production of multiple task-, user-, system-, as well as learning-centric results, as well as the benefits of our natural imitation-based approach towards teleoperation. Furthermore, an interesting ordering of preferences towards different potential application areas of teleoperation is indicated by our data.

The user is assumed to perform the same type of sport motion as an expert, and therefore the performer\u2019s motion is more or less similar to the expert\u2019s reference motion.

A fully-automatic detection of the patient\u2019s position, orientation, posture and pose on the patient table holds great potential for optimizing this part of the imaging workflow. We propose a markerless framework that is capable of extracting this information within seconds from either range imaging (RI) or pressure imaging (PI) data.MethodsThe proposed method is composed of three stages: First, the position and orientation of the reclined patient are determined. Second, the patient\u2019s posture is classified. Third, based on the estimated orientation and posture, an approximate body pose is recovered by fitting an articulated model to the observed RI/PI data. Being a key issue for clinical application, our approach does not require an initialization pose.ResultsIn a case study on real data from 16 subjects, the performance of the proposed system was evaluated quantitatively with a 3-D time-of-flight RI camera and a pressure sensing mattress (PI). The patient orientation was successfully determined for all subjects, independent of the modality. At the posture recognition stage, our method achieved mean classification rates of 79.4% for RI and 95.5% for PI data, respectively. Concerning the approximate body pose estimation, anatomical body landmarks were localized with an accuracy of \u00b15.84cm (RI) and \u00b15.53cm (PI).ConclusionsThe results indicate that an estimation of the patient\u2019s position, orientation, posture and pose using RI and PI sensors, respectively, is feasible, and beneficial for optimizing the workflow in diagnostic tomographic imaging.

How the nervous system combines \u201cweight\u201d and \u201csize\u201d cues with prior experience and whether these cues are differentially integrated for perception and sensorimotor action is still not fully understood. Therefore, we assessed not only whether the experience of size biases weight perception, but also if experience of weight biases the size perception of objects. Further, to investigate differences between perceptual and motor systems for cue-experience integration, participants haptically explored the weight of an object with one hand and then shaped the aperture of their other hand to indicate its perceived size. Results\u2014First, next to a SWI, healthy adults (N\u00a0=\u00a021) perceived lighter objects as being smaller and heavier objects as being larger, demonstrating a weight\u2013size illusion (WSI).

Hand openings were consistently smaller than physical size, with SWI-sensitive participants being significantly more affected than WSI-sensitive subjects. We conclude: first, both size and weight perceptions are biased by prior experience. Weight perception is biased by expectations of size, while size perception is influenced by the expectancy of weight. Second, humans have the tendency to use one cue predominantly for both types of perception. Third, combining perceived weight with expected size influenced hand motor control, while online haptic feedback was largely ignored.

A common treatment, surgical anterior capsule tightening, assumes that the instability is caused by abnormal anterior laxity. This study investigated the possibility that one element of overall imbalance, posterior capsular tightness, could be an underlying reason for shoulder instability. Surgical navigation technology, which is more accurate than whole-body motion-capture systems, was used to study anterior translational motions.MethodThe study was used four cadaver shoulders, with the scapula and rotator cuff muscles intact. Opto-electronic surgical navigation localization devices were mounted on the scapula and humerus to accurately capture positions and orientations. The shoulders were passively moved through 7 motions, 5 of simple angulation and 2 combinations of clinical interest. Each motion was repeated in 4 different soft-tissue states: rotator cuff intact, capsule intact, and surgically induced capsular tightnesses of 5 and 10mm.ResultsThe shoulders had significantly greater anterior translation when the posterior capsule was artificially tightened (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); this was particularly in movements that combined abduction with internal or external rotation, which are typical overhead sports motions. Overall translation was indifferent to whether the shoulders were intact or dissected down to the capsule, as was translation during flexion was indifferent to dissection state (p\u00a0>\u00a00.95).ConclusionSurgical navigation technology can easily be used to analyze cadaveric shoulder motion, with opportunities for adaptation to anesthetized patients.

Given this, it is somewhat surprising that the problem of time series clustering from a single stream remains largely unsolved. Most work on time series clustering considers the clustering of individual time series that have been carefully extracted from their original context, for example, gene expression profiles, individual heartbeats, or individual gait cycles. The few attempts at clustering time series streams have been shown to be objectively incorrect in some cases, and in other cases shown to work only on the most contrived synthetic datasets by carefully adjusting a large set of parameters. In this work, we make two fundamental contributions that allow for the first time, the meaningful clustering of subsequences from a time series stream. First, we show that the problem definition for time series clustering from streams currently used is inherently flawed, and a new definition is necessary. Second, we show that the minimum description length framework offers an efficient, effective, and essentially parameter-free method for time series clustering.

The aim is to separate static information called \u201cbackground\u201d from the moving objects called \u201cforeground\u201d. The background needs to be modeled and updated over time to allow robust foreground detection. Recently, reconstructive subspace learning models, such as principal component analysis (PCA) have been used to model the background by significantly reducing the data\u2019s dimension. This approach is based on the assumption that the main information contained in the training sequence is the background meaning that the foreground has a low contribution. However, this assumption is only verified when the moving objects are either small or far away from the camera. Furthermore, the reconstructive representations strive to be as informative as possible in terms of well approximating the original data. Their objective is mainly to encompass the variability of the training data and so they give more effort to model the background in an unsupervised manner than to precisely classify pixels as foreground or background in the foreground detection. On the other hand, discriminative methods are usually less adapted to the reconstruction of data; although they are spatially and computationally much more efficient and often give better classification results compared with the reconstructive methods. Based on this fact, we propose the use of a discriminative subspace learning model called incremental maximum margin criterion (IMMC). The objective is first to enable a robust supervised initialization of the background and secondly a robust classification of pixels as background or foreground. Furthermore, IMMC also allows us an incremental update of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

The main finding was that the memory of the height of stairs was enhanced when information about stair height was gained by walking up a short flight of stairs compared to when information about stair height was gained by vision alone. By measuring the maximum toe clearance when subjects step onto a stair, we observed that maximum toe clearance increased after diverting vision from the stair for a few seconds prior to stepping. Most of this increase occurred within a 2-s period between diverting vision from the stair and initiating the step. By contrast, this increase in maximum toe clearance after diverting vision from a stair was significantly reduced after subjects walked up two stairs prior to stepping onto a stair without vision. This reduction persisted for delays as long as 10\u00a0s between diverting vision from the stair and initiating the step.

It is one of the earliest forelimb behaviours displayed by human infants, who bring almost all grasped objects to the mouth, and is used daily by adults. In adults, there is a tight coupling between visual attention and the advance phase of the reach-to-eat movement. The target is visually engaged just as hand advance is initiated and visually disengaged just as the target is grasped. This coupling of vision and hand advance suggests that advance is mediated by visual attention and withdrawal by somatosensation. The present study examined when the tight coupling between visual attention and the advance phase of the movement develops in infancy. In a longitudinal study, eight infants, aged 6\u201312\u00a0months, and 20 adults reached for familiar inanimate objects and food items. Visual gaze, hand movement and hand accuracy were measured using frame-by-frame video scoring and 2D kinematic analysis. The study found that the youngest infants (6\u20138\u00a0months) visually engaged the target well before initiating a reaching movement and continued to fixate on the target after it was grasped and as it was brought to the mouth. Between 10 and 12\u00a0months of age, infants began to visually engage the target just as the reaching movement was initiated and visually disengaged the target as it was grasped, as did the adults. Over the same developmental time period, the infants developed rotatory hand shaping movements, precision grasping, and improved targeting accuracy both for grasping the object and placing it into the mouth.

After stroke, individuals demonstrate a diminished ability to perform dual-tasks. Current evidence suggests that conventional rehabilitation does not adequately address gait-related dual-task impairments after stroke, which may be contributing to low levels of participation and physical inactivity in community-dwelling stroke survivors. The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of dual-task gait training in community-dwelling adults within 1 year of stroke. Specifically, we will compare the effects of dual-task gait training and single-task gait training on cognitive-motor interference during walking at preferred speed and at fastest comfortable speed (Aim 1), locomotor control during obstacle negotiation (Aim 2), and spontaneous physical activity (Aim 3).Methods/DesignThis single-blind randomized controlled trial will involve 44 individuals within 12 months of stroke. Following baseline evaluation, participants will be randomly allocated to single- or dual-task gait training. Both groups will receive 12, 30-minute sessions provided one-on-one over 4\u20136 weeks in an outpatient therapy setting. Single-task gait training involves practice of gait activities incorporating motor relearning principles. Dual-task gait training involves an identical gait training protocol; the critical difference being that the dual-task gait training group will practice the gait activities while simultaneously performing a cognitive task for 75% of the repetitions. Blinded assessors will measure outcomes at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 months after completion of the intervention. The primary outcome measure will be dual-task effects on gait speed and cognition during unobstructed walking. Secondary outcomes include spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters during unobstructed single- and dual-task walking at preferred and fastest comfortable walking speeds, gait parameters during high and low obstacle crossing, spontaneous physical activity, executive function, lower extremity motor function, Timed Up and Go, balance self-efficacy, number of falls, and stroke-related disability. Hypotheses for each aim will be tested using an intention-to-treat analysis with repeated measures ANOVA design.DiscussionThis trial will provide evidence to help clinicians make decisions about the types of activities to include in rehabilitation to improve dual-task walking after stroke.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT01568957", "coverDate": "", "number": "1", "publicationName": "BMC Neurology", "publicationDate": "2012-10-31", "endingPage": "8", "openaccess": "true", "printDate": "", "copyright": "\u00a92012 Plummer-D'Amato et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "title": "Training dual-task walking in community-dwelling adults within 1 year of stroke: a protocol for a single-blind randomized controlled trial", "identifier": "doi:10.1186/1471-2377-12-129", "contentType": "Article", "topicalCollection": "", "volume": "12", "startingPage": "1", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "eissn": "", "publisher": "BioMed Central", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2377-12-129", "onlineDate": "", "url": [{"platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2377-12-129", "format": ""}], "articleCategory": "", "issn": "1471-2377", "issuetype": "", "creators": [{"creator": "Plummer-D\u2019Amato, Prudence"}, {"creator": "Kyvelidou, Anastasia"}, {"creator": "Sternad, Dagmar"}, {"creator": "Najafi, Bijan"}, {"creator": "Villalobos, Raymond M"}, {"creator": "Zurakowski, David"}]}, {"journalid": "12891", "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundThe single-leg squat (SLS) is a common test used by clinicians for the musculoskeletal assessment of the lower limb. The aim of the current study was to reveal the kinematic parameters used by experienced and inexperienced clinicians to determine SLS performance and establish reliability of such assessment.MethodsTwenty-two healthy, young adults (23.8 \u00b1 3.1 years) performed three SLSs on each leg whilst being videoed. Three-dimensional data for the hip and knee was recorded using a 10-camera optical motion analysis system (Vicon, Oxford, UK). SLS performance was rated from video data using a 10-point ordinal scale by experienced musculoskeletal physiotherapists and student physiotherapists. All ratings were undertaken a second time at least two weeks after the first by the same raters. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to determine kinematic predictors of SLS performance scores and inter- and intra-rater reliability were determined using a two-way mixed model to generate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC3,1) of consistency.ResultsOne SLS per leg for each participant was used for analysis, providing 44 SLSs in total. Eight experienced physiotherapists and eight physiotherapy students agreed to rate each SLS.

Most falls occur during gait, which is primarily regulated by foot placement. Variability of foot placement has been associated with falls, but these associations are inconsistent and generally for smooth, level flooring. This study investigates the control of foot placement and the associated gait variability in younger and older men and women (N=7/group, total N=28) while walking at three different speeds (slow, preferred, and fast) across a control surface with no obstacles and surfaces with multiple (64) small (10cm long \u00d713mm high) visible and hidden obstacles.ResultsMinimum obstacle distance between the shoe and nearest obstacle during each footfall was greater on the visible obstacles surface for older subjects because some of them chose to actively avoid obstacles. This obstacle avoidance strategy was implemented primarily by modulating step width and to a lesser extent step length as indicated by linear regressions of step width and length variability on minimum obstacle distance. Mean gait speed, step length, step width, and step time did not significantly differ by subject group, flooring surface, or obstacle avoidance strategy.ConclusionsSome healthy older subjects choose to actively avoid small obstacles that do not substantially perturb their gait by modulating step width and, to a lesser extent, step length. It is not clear if this obstacle avoidance strategy is appropriate and beneficial or overcautious and maladaptive, as it results in fewer obstacles encountered at a consequence of a less efficient gait pattern that has been shown to indicate increased fall risk. Further research is needed on the appropriateness of strategy selection when the environmental demands and/or task requirements have multiple possible completion strategies with conflicting objectives (i.e. perceived safety vs. efficiency).", "coverDate": "", "number": "1", "publicationName": "Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation", "publicationDate": "2012-10-03", "endingPage": "10", "openaccess": "true", "printDate": "", "copyright": "\u00a92012 Schulz; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "title": "Healthy younger and older adults control foot placement to avoid small obstacles during gait primarily by modulating step width", "identifier": "doi:10.1186/1743-0003-9-69", "contentType": "Article", "topicalCollection": "", "volume": "9", "startingPage": "1", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "eissn": "", "publisher": "BioMed Central", "doi": "10.1186/1743-0003-9-69", "onlineDate": "", "url": [{"platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-0003-9-69", "format": ""}], "articleCategory": "", "issn": "1743-0003", "issuetype": "", "creators": [{"creator": "Schulz, Brian W"}]}, {"journalid": "11263", "abstract": "AbstractAction recognition and pose estimation are two closely related topics in understanding human body movements; information from one task can be leveraged to assist the other, yet the two are often treated separately.

Reaching this spatial position in many everyday actions often exceeds the average amplitude of a finger movement. The aim of this study is to address how people coordinate their movement to be in the right place at the right time when the scale of the movement varies. Does the scale of the movement and accuracy demands of the movement change the ability to accurately synchronise?

Since in vivo data on the pathomechanisms of FAI are limited, it is still unclear how this deformity leads to osteoarthritis.Purpose:The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of cam FAI on hip joint mechanical loading using finite element analysis, by incorporating subject-specific geometries, kinematics, and kinetics.Questions:The research objectives were to address and determine: (1) if hips with cam FAI demonstrate higher maximum shear stresses, in comparison with control hips; (2) the magnitude of the peak maximum shear stresses; and (3) the locations of the peak maximum shear stresses.Methods:Using finite element analysis, two patient models were control-matched and simulated during quasi-static positions from standing to squatting. Intersegmental hip forces, from a previous study, were applied to the subject-specific hip geometries, segmented from CT data, to evaluate the maximum shear stresses on the acetabular cartilage and underlying bone.Results:Peak maximum shear stresses were found at the anterosuperior region of the underlying bone during squatting. The peaks at the anterosuperior acetabulum were substantially higher for the patients (15.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\u00a0MPa) in comparison with the controls (4.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u00a0MPa).Conclusions:Peaks were not situated on the cartilage, but instead located on the underlying bone. The results correspond with the locations of initial cartilage degradation observed during surgical treatment and from MRI.Clinical Relevance:These findings support the pathomechanism of cam FAI. Changes may originate from the underlying subchondral bone properties rather than direct shear stresses to the articular cartilage.", "coverDate": "", "number": "3", "publicationName": "HSS Journal \u00ae", "publicationDate": "2012-10-01", "endingPage": "212", "openaccess": "false", "printDate": "", "copyright": "\u00a92012 Hospital for Special Surgery", "title": "Finite Element Analysis Examining the Effects of Cam FAI on Hip Joint Mechanical Loading Using Subject-Specific Geometries During Standing and Maximum Squat", "identifier": "doi:10.1007/s11420-012-9292-x", "contentType": "Article", "topicalCollection": "", "volume": "8", "startingPage": "206", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "eissn": "", "publisher": "Springer", "doi": "10.1007/s11420-012-9292-x", "onlineDate": "", "url": [{"platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11420-012-9292-x", "format": ""}], "articleCategory": "", "issn": "1556-3324", "issuetype": "", "creators": [{"creator": "Ng, K.

The location of the hip center has been estimated using functional techniques using various limb motions. However, it is not clear which specific motions best predicted the functional center.PurposeThis study aims to compare the predicted functional center of the hip evaluated from multiplanar circumduction and star motions, and to compare this functional center with the geometric center.MethodsEight hips in four fresh\u2013frozen cadavers were used and verified as morphologically normal in CT scans. Three-dimensional motion of each lower limb was recorded using arrays of reflective markers rigidly attached to the femur and pelvis. Each hip was manipulated to produce circumduction or star motion, i.e., abduction\u2013adduction and flexion extension. The hip was then dissected and the bearing surface traced with a probe, from which a best-fit sphere was calculated. The functional center was calculated from the motion data and compared to the geometric technique.ResultsThere was no difference between the functional hip center predicted by circumduction or star motions, although this was offset from the geometric hip center by up to 14\u00a0mm. For all except two hips, the functional center was less than 6\u00a0mm from the geometric hip in each anatomic direction. Test\u2013retest differences were smaller for circumduction than for star motions.ConclusionsEstimation of the hip center based on motion of the femur relative to the pelvis could localize the geometric center of the joint within 14\u00a0mm and circumduction motions were more repeatable.Clinical RelevanceMany surgical navigation systems make use of the functional hip center as a landmark for alignment or reconstruction. Errors associated with this would have a very minor influence in lower limb alignment, e.g., for knee reconstruction, but could affect proximal femoral geometry relevant to hip reconstruction.", "coverDate": "", "number": "3", "publicationName": "HSS Journal \u00ae", "publicationDate": "2012-10-01", "endingPage": "197", "openaccess": "false", "printDate": "", "copyright": "\u00a92012 Hospital for Special Surgery", "title": "The Accuracy of the Use of Functional Hip Motions on Localization of the Center of the Hip", "identifier": "doi:10.1007/s11420-012-9296-6", "contentType": "Article", "topicalCollection": "", "volume": "8", "startingPage": "192", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "eissn": "", "publisher": "Springer", "doi": "10.1007/s11420-012-9296-6", "onlineDate": "", "url": [{"platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11420-012-9296-6", "format": ""}], "articleCategory": "", "issn": "1556-3324", "issuetype": "", "creators": [{"creator": "Speirs, Andrew D"}, {"creator": "Benoit, Daniel L"}, {"creator": "Beaulieu, M\u00e9lanie L"}, {"creator": "Lamontagne, Mario"}, {"creator": "Beaul\u00e9, Paul E."}]}, {"journalid": "13063", "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundIncreasing evidence suggests that use of augmented visual feedback could be a useful approach to stroke rehabilitation. In current clinical practice, visual feedback of movement performance is often limited to the use of mirrors or video. However, neither approach is optimal since cognitive and self-image issues can distract or distress patients and their movement can be obscured by clothing or limited viewpoints. Three-dimensional motion capture has the potential to provide accurate kinematic data required for objective assessment and feedback in the clinical environment. However, such data are currently presented in numerical or graphical format, which is often impractical in a clinical setting. Our hypothesis is that presenting this kinematic data using bespoke visualisation software, which is tailored for gait rehabilitation after stroke, will provide a means whereby feedback of movement performance can be communicated in a more meaningful way to patients. This will result in increased patient understanding of their rehabilitation and will enable progress to be tracked in a more accessible way.MethodsThe hypothesis will be assessed using an exploratory (phase II) randomised controlled trial. Stroke survivors eligible for this trial will be in the subacute stage of stroke and have impaired walking ability (Functional Ambulation Classification of 1 or more). Participants (n\u2009=\u200945) will be randomised into three groups to compare the use of the visualisation software during overground physical therapy gait training against an intensity-matched and attention-matched placebo group and a usual care control group. The primary outcome measure will be walking speed. Secondary measures will be Functional Ambulation Category, Timed Up and Go, Rivermead Visual Gait Assessment, Stroke Impact Scale-16 and spatiotemporal parameters associated with walking. Additional qualitative measures will be used to assess the participant\u2019s experience of the visual feedback provided in the study.DiscussionResults from the trial will explore whether the early provision of visual feedback of biomechanical movement performance during gait rehabilitation demonstrates improved mobility outcomes after stroke and increased patient understanding of their rehabilitation.Trial registrationCurrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN79005974", "coverDate": "", "number": "1", "publicationName": "Trials", "publicationDate": "2012-09-11", "endingPage": "7", "openaccess": "true", "printDate": "", "copyright": "\u00a92012 Thikey et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "title": "Augmented visual feedback of movement performance to enhance walking recovery after stroke: study protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial", "identifier": "doi:10.1186/1745-6215-13-163", "contentType": "Article", "topicalCollection": "", "volume": "13", "startingPage": "1", "genre": "OriginalPaper", "eissn": "", "publisher": "BioMed Central", "doi": "10.1186/1745-6215-13-163", "onlineDate": "", "url": [{"platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1745-6215-13-163", "format": ""}], "articleCategory": "", "issn": "1745-6215", "issuetype": "", "creators": [{"creator": "Thikey, Heather"}, {"creator": "Grealy, Madeleine"}, {"creator": "van Wijck, Frederike"}, {"creator": "Barber, Mark"}, {"creator": "Rowe, Philip"}]}], "result": [{"recordsDisplayed": "50", "start": "1", "total": "418", "pageLength": "50"}], "query": "(\"motion capture\" AND year:2012)"}
