Message Services in Computer Networks In this paper we discuss the key issues in the generation and distribution of messages in a computer network. The principal issues are: user support, privacy and security, addressing, and standards and regulations. Examples of current message systems on the ARPANET are discussed. Defense Packet Switching Networks in the United States In this paper we review the primary characteristics of the U.S. Department of Defense packet switching networks -- ARPANET, AUTODIN II, and WIN. Special requirements for dedicated defense networks are examined. These include privacy and security, precedence, survivability, availability, and interoperability with other networks. Finally, we discuss some architectural concepts for an all digital integrated voice/data network for defense applications in the 1990â€™s. Some Service Aspects of the X25 Interface This paper reviews the problems in defining quality of service at the X25 interface, in the light of existing information on network service, and developments in the definition of X25 service between networks. Job Transfer in Open Systems The general understanding of Job Transfer/Remote Job Entry in an Open System Architecture is outlined and functions necessary to perform a Job Transfer service according to that understanding are discussed. Guide line for the discussion is the idea of job networking. In a slightly different way most of existing JT/RJE protocols apply this netjob idea. The description of a netjob and its execution according to the communication protocol are explained. On that basis and with regard to the ISO layered model the question of how to proceed with standardisation is discussed.
