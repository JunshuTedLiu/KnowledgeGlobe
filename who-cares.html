            <p class="lead">Our potential target users.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Knowledge Globe is designed for anyone with a curiosity in the evolution of Knowledge and how it leads to the change of the world.</p>
            <p>Our tool will help future scholars for their researches in multiple aspects. For the historian, they can now observe something from an academic perspective with the help of Springer’s database. For students, they now have a powerful and user-friendly tool that could help them achieve their research goals easily, no matter what they are majoring in.</p>
            <p>KnoGlo also works for all people who would like to see the change in the industries that they are getting involved with. For statisticians, KnoGlo’s Statistical Metadata Visualization tool is a great choice for them to see a trend of a topic and it changes over the year in different countries. It could even benefit for data analysts to make predictions by seeing the change for specific topics.</p>
            <p>For linguists, KnoGlo offers a productive way to make corpus with accurate and quality contents, and analyze these contents with the NLP analytics technique. For other researchers who would like to take an in-depth look at the contents for the selected publications, the Topic Modeling tool would be a great choice to analyze the topics mentioned and see what are popular and gaining more attention.</p>

            <h2>Why does KnoGlo valuable?</h2>
            <p class="lead">How it will benefit for future scholars to do their research.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>First of all, compare to other scholar services, KnoGlo provides a new perspective for us to see how knowledge changes, and even how the world changes.</p>
            <p>Second, it is dependable and reliable with the help of our data provider, Springer Nature. We believe that it is important to tell true stories by using true data. Besides, the database is massive that contains 12 million publications for us to access, it is an ideal data source for KnoGlo’s statistical dataset generation tool and corpus generator.</p>
            <p>Third, it offers a great way to demonstrate a phenomenon or telling a story.</p>
            <p>And lastly, it is easy to use. The Python and R tool are easy to install and run, and with the help of Jupyter Notebook that is an ideal tool for NLP analytics, the overall research experience is fast, productive, and enjoyable.</p>

                <ul>
                    <dd>an academic field concerned with the application of computational tools and methods to traditional humanities disciplines such as literature, history, and philosophy.</dd>
                </ul>
            </dl>
            <p>The idea of Knowledge Globe came out from my brain during the second semester of the Digital Studies program in the Division of the Humanities at the University of Chicago. This is the very first time that UChicago is running this program that relates to both computer programming and humanities research. The main focuses of the thesis project are to build tools for researches in the field of humanities using computational skills.</p>
            <p>From the beginning, we are focusing on Data Management, Analysis, and Visualization. We strongly agree that data visualization is a process of storytelling, and in order to tell a story, we need truths. For us who are playing the rules of both a software developer and humanist, the truth is data.</p>
            <p>Data visualization is a story-telling process. Knowledge Globe provides a statistical perspective for people to view the history, within a flexible choice of range, no matter the time or space. It tells history in a convincing and intuitive way. Just like this one, digital/computational tools can help people accomplish their research goals more productive than ever before.</p>
            <p>Doing research requires a lot of resources, like contents and data, especially for the study of humanities. Using modern technology with computer and database, with data management, visualization, and NLP methods, we can make a tool for scholars and researchers to reach their goal in an easy way, and even delivers accurate and dependable results. This is one of the ways how computational tools and methods applied to humanities disciplines. In other words, this is how Digital Humanities should be demonstrated. And that motivates me all the time as a mission when I was making Knowledge Globe.</p>
