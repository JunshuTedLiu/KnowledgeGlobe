            <p><strong>Junshu Liu</strong>, also known as Ted, is the founder and director of this project. He is a graduate student in UChicago majoring Digital Studies of Language, Culture, and History. Since August 2014, he has been started his adventure, living, learning, and discovering in the United States. He is a developer, designer, and creator. Besides his concentrations regarding Digital Media, HCI, and UI/UX design, he has been studying data science for the researches of humanities, history, and culture over the past 12 months. Besides, he loves making videos as one of his biggest hobbies. Learn more about Junshu and his past projects at <a href="https://junshuliu.com">junshuliu.com</a>.

            <p>
                Professor <strong>David Schloen</strong> is the adviser of the Knowledge Globe project. He is the director and a co-founder of the Master of Arts in Digital Studies of Language, Culture, and History program. Besides, he is a faculty member in the Oriented Institute and the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, where he is also an associated faculty member of the Divinity School. With the math and computer science background along with his academic career in ancient Near Eastern studies, Dr. Schloen has an insightful view of Digital Humanities.

                Professor <strong>Jeffrey R. Tharsen</strong> is one of the technical advisers of this project. He is an excellent person who masters not only data science and linguistics but also East Asian language and culture. With the help of Dr. Tharsen, I learned a lot of Python and R programming skills for both data visualization and NLP analytics, which leads to the success of this product. Learn more about Dr. Tharsen from his website, <a href="http://tharsen.net/">tharsen.net</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professor <strong>Miller Prosser</strong> is also a professional data analyst that proficient in a lot of data management software and tools. During the Data Management course, he taught us how to use LibreOffice to queue datasets, which became part of our case studies for the KnoGlo project. Also, without his help during the Data Publication course, we wouldn’t have the web version of KnoGlo. As a beginner in data science, I learned a lot with the help of Dr. Prosser since the beginning of the Fall 2018 quarter. Learn more about Dr. Prosser from UChicago’s <a href="https://ochre.uchicago.edu/directory/miller-prosser">OCHRE</a> website.

                Knowledge Globe is a thesis project supported by the <a href="https://digitalstudies.uchicago.edu/">M.A. in Digital Studies of Language, Culture, and History program</a> at the University of Chicago. Who designed, created, and participated in this project are students and faculties from this brand-new 1-year graduate program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Junshu came with the idea of this project when he was taking the Data Management course offered by Dr. Prosser and the Data Analysis course by Dr. Tharsen in the Fall 2018 quarter. The 1.0 version was released in December 2018 as the final project for both of these two courses, along with the first version of the website. KnoGlo v1.0 is basically the statistical metadata visualization tool in Python and R.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the winter quarter, Junshu was taking the Natural Language Processing course offered by Dr. Tharsen. That's why one of the new feature in the KnoGlo 2.0 version was born, which is the corpus generator and NLP analysis tool. He was also taking the Data Publication course by Dr. Prosser, which covers web design and development, includes JavaScript, JQuery, and XML + DOM, which was used for the web version of this project.
